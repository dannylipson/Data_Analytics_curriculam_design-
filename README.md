Data science, analytics, AI, big data are becoming widely used in many fields, that leads to the ever-increasing demand of data analysts, data scientists and other data professionals. Due to that, data science education is now a hot topic for educators and entrepreneurs.

In this project, out team have first re-designed the course curriculum for “MIE1624: Introduction to Data Science and Analytics” course at University of Toronto, such that students can acquire an introduction to the most relevant topics and skills in data science and AI. Second, our team have designed a curriculum for a new “Master of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence” program at University of Toronto with focus not only on technical but also on business and soft skills, see, e.g., http://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/Degrees/MastersPrograms/MMA, http://smith.queensu.ca/grad_studies/mmai/, http://www.hec.ca/en/programs/masters/master- data-science-business-analytics/, http://mbai.kse.ua, or http://schulich.yorku.ca/programs/mmai/, that contains optimal courses (and internships, projects, extra-curricular activities, etc.) for students to obtain necessary technical and business skills to pursue a successful career as data scientist, analytics and data manager, data analyst, business analyst, AI system designer, etc. Third, our team have developed own analytics-based solution in education field (PathFinder1.0)
